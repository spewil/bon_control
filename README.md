**kyber** - governance, control, or steering

**physics** - the study of information and dynamics

When we talk about human ability, we often use theory and experimental results from *psychophysics*, the formalization of perception and sensation in the language of physics. 

Here, we are interested in the inverse: developing an understanding of action, control, and learning in the language of physics. We call this *kyberphysics*.
